<p> My name is, Damon McLean, and I'm a beginner web designer with a passion to try to get a career in the field of computer
programing. As of right now, I'm a junior in highschool and I'm trying to learn as much code as possible before college. 
I feel I should get a head start on the game before the time comes to show what I'm worth.
My main dream job would be in Web design, or computer software engineer.

<li>HTML</li> <li>CSS</li> <li>C++</li> <li>C#</li></ol><hr width="100%" color="#000000"></p>
<p>I began coding when I was in 6-7th grade. The thing that interested me so much about was the ability to make
the computer do what I want it to do. To be able to tell it to do extreme multiplication runs, or just very tiny
movements on the screen. Just the thought of using such language/s brought so much to the table for me. 
When I was about six, I began playing on the computer. 
To many people, they think " Thats too young! Your going to influence him the wrong way!!" 
To be honest, I feel more in control than my fellow peers that havent been on the computer for long.
My dad was a huge gamer and still is; He taught me the discipline of playing online with complete strangers. 
How to act, and not to act, also on to never really believe someone if they ask for private information.
I took this information and applied it to real life, treat everyone the way you want,
and that is the way you wil be treated. Who knew video games could teach a kid so much on the way to act in
public, and online. Today's generation of kids, do not understand the power of this technology, can ruin lifes,
even people! </p></font>
