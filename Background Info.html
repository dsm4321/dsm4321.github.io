  <p> My name is, Damon McLean, and I'm a beginner web designer with a passion to try to get a career in the field of computer programing. As of right now, I'm a junior in highschool and I'm trying to learn as much code as possible before college. I feel I should get a head start on the game before the time comes to show what I'm worth. My main dream job would be in Web design, or computer software engineer.</p><hr width="100%" color="#000000"><p>Some languages that I'm beginning to learn are: <ol><li> Python</li> <li>Java</li> <li>HTML</li> <li>CSS</li> <li>C++</li> <li>C#</li></ol><hr width="100%" color="#000000"></p><p>I began coding when I was in 6-7th grade. The thing that interested me so much about was the ability to make the computer do what I want it to do. To be able to tell it to do extreme multiplication runs, or just very tiny movements on the screen. Just the thought of using such language/s brought so much to the table for me. When I was about four, I began playing on the computer. To many people, they think " Thats too young! Your going to influence him the wrong way!!" To be honest, I feel more in control than my fellow peers that havent been on the computer for long. My dad was a huge gamer and still is; He taught me the discipline of playing online with complete strangers. How to act, and not to act, also on to never really believe someone if they ask for private information. I took this information and applied it to real life, treat everyone the way you want, and that is the way you wil be treated. Who knew video games could teach a kid so much on the way to act in public, and online. Today's generation of kids, do not understand the power of this technology, can ruin lifes, even people! </p><hr width="100%" color="#000000">
